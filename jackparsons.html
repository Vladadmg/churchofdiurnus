<font size="+0" color="silver"><p>I will attempt to present you with the outline of a practical reduction of the philosophy behind the Book of the Law, as it applies to our modern life.</p>
<p>This will be difficult since there is an enormous background of technical, historical, social, and psychological data which I will be forced to omit. This is available. I hope you will be sufficiently interested to review it for your self, if you have not done so. </p></td></TR></TABLE>
<font size="+0" color="silver"><p>If you will remember that I am dealing with the end product of this material, and trying, in a very shot period, to condense this into a practical conclusion, I will appreciate your tolerance.</p>
<p>There are certain individuals who aspire to a maximum of independence in thought and in action, in order to achieve the optimum in the function of there nature and their creative will.</p>
<p>From among such have come the dreamers and creators, the leaders and revolutionaries, artist and poets and scientist. All that we know of progress and of culture has come from them --- all out of the Neolithic swamp, by fire and air, by earth and water, and by the creative word, has come from those minds, from those hands.</p>
<p>The anthropoid mind fears and mistrusts such sports, and rides an unwilling ape on the coattails of the creative evolute. Unwilling, unwitting, and often something more than that.</p>
<p>In the indomitable will of the first order genius, there is sufficient ferocity of subtlety to overcome arboreal opposition, although the manifest result is usually <I>post mortem,</I> over a somewhat mutilated corpse. </p>
<p>But there are numberless fine minds, men and women of high talent and culture, who lacking in a little certainty, or facing an overwhelming social opposition, have deployed unto futility and failure.</p>
<p>We propose a philosophy and a way of life having a pragmatic appeal to such minds.</p>
<p>A vast number of the human race has the mentality of slaves. Following Barnum, we can also deduce an appropriate number of slave masters.</p>
<p>There is no criticism here. The orders of nature are obvious, and acceptable to the philosophic. But, to the slave mind, there is often something unendurable in the notion of freedom and independence; it would have us all as its brother in bondage. With this, the slave masters are in full accord.</p>
<p>It would be tedious to examine the techniques by which slavery has been fostered, the superstitious and authoritative devices, religious, political, social and economic, which has forged the chains. Whole philosophies, conceiving the universe of nature as sorrow, and the nature of man as sin, have been constructed to the palliate sacrifice, expiation, and obedience.</p>
<p>God and Pope and king, society, humanity, the people, the proletariat, the family, war, the national emergency and all other bogeys from the armory of fear have been summoned to confront the non-groveler. And those psychological weapons have been terribly enhanced.</p>
<p>This is obvious, and there is room in the world for animal acts and animal trainers --- but not more than enough room!</p>
<p>If the individual abdicates his independence in the face of this rabbit hypnosis, this prestige suggestion, then he has deserved the bondage into which he is delivered.</p>
<p>It is a matter of balance. The leopard won't change its spots, --- not very rapidly, nor is it needed that he should. It is only needed that the lion takes his proper place in the jungle and keep the leopard where he belongs, and the rabbit.</p>
<p>The creative individual must take his place as a creative leader in society. He must fulfill his destiny and his responsibility; he can achieve both in fearlessly following his creative will, his own inner truth, and in inevitable corollary, he must know and assist others who strive to do likewise.</p>
<p>Then, by leading the slaved a little out of slavery, and the masters a little into humanity and culture, maintaining all the while his own inviolable independence, he will achieve balance which lone gives significance to the human story.</p></font>

<p>This exposition of Rights of Man is a statement of first principles.</p>
<p> You are referred to Crowley's works, the writings of Nietzsche, Mencken and Bertrand Russell, Emerson's essay on Self-Reliance, the Declaration of Independence and Bill of Rights in the American Constitution. Here I am not unduly concerned with theory, but with you, who, like myself, have independently reached these conclusions, and who are interested in a practical reduction.</p>
<p>Freedom is twofold; there is freedom within, and the freedom without, and , like all things, the first freedom starts at home plate.</p>
<p>The mainspring of an individual is his creative will. This will is the tone of his tendencies, his destiny, his inner truth. It is one with the force that makes birds sing and flowers bloom; as inevitable as gravity, as implicit as a bowel movement, it forms alike atoms of men and suns.</p>
<p>To a man who knows this will, there is no why or why not; no can or cannot; he is!</p>
<p>There is no known force that can turn an apple into an alley cat; there is no known force that can turn a man from his will. This triumph of genius, that, surviving the centuries, enlightens the world.</p>

<p>This force burns in every man.</p>
<p>There are those who are too cowardly, too weak, to see or express it.</p>
<p>There are those who are full of pretense, of gullibility, of fear and greed, to give it an utterance.</p>
<p> There is a lot of bitterness, failure and frustration; dust and ashes are their portion.</p>
<p>They are those who are bewildered, at odds with themselves, over-whelmed by adversity. They seek the light, and if they persevere, they will find it --- within Themselves.</p></td>

<p>What are the obstacles to the attainment of the Will? There are many, but they may be grouped into a certain primary divisions. And the name of every one of them is <b>FEAR</b>.</p>
<p>1. Fear of Incompetence: I would like to, but I could never do it. This is the flimsiest of excuses; --- a narcissistic pap poisoning creation at its source. Confidence, enthusiasm, belief, egotism, are the roots of creation. <b>BELIEVE IN YOURSELF:</b> that is the first rule. Humility can come later. Build yourself to yourself --- be proud --- you are unique, and marvelously made. There is no other like you.</p>
