<p>In the following space provided and in your own words please describe your life up until the present time. Try to include important events and experiences --- regardless of how insignificant they may seem to others --- and please describe how you feel they may have helped shape your life for better of worse. Start from the earliest point you can remember. Ages and dates are hepful. It is important for you to be as honest and candid as you possibly can be. Use as many words as you think are necessary --- although there is a 3000 word maximum --- please don't over do it. The best descriptions are those that are blunt and to the point. And remember --- we are more concerned with content than correct spelling and punctuation. Take your time and fill this out to the best of your ability. Upon completion click the "Submit Application" button below and a Church Facilitator or Inner Order member will review your work and responde to you by email or regular mail. <TEXTAREA name="Your life story" size="3000" ROWS=10 COLS=90 WRAP="virtual">
