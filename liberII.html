<p><font size="-1" font color="red">The key to this message is the word --- Will. The first obvious meaning of the Law is confirmed by antithesis: "The word of sin is restriction."
Again: "Thou hast no right but to do thy will. Do that and no other shall say nay. For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect." </p>

<p>Take this carefully; it seems to imply a theory that if every man and every woman did his or her Will --- the true Will --- there would be no clashing. "Every man and every woman is a star", and each star moves in an appointed path without interference. There is plenty of room for all; it is only disorder that created confusion. </p>

<p>From these considerations it should be clear that "Do what thou wilt" does mean "Do what you like." It is the apotheosis of freedom; but it is also the strictest possible bond. </p>

<p>Do what thou wilt --- then do something else. Let nothing deflect thee from the austere and holy task. Liberty is absolute to do thy will; but seek to do any other thing whatever, and instantly obstacles must arise. Every act that is not in definite course of that one orbit is erratic, a hindrance. Will must not be two but one. </p>
<p>Note further that this Will is not only to be pure, that is, single, as explained above, but also "unassuaged of purpose." This strange phrase must give us pause. It may mean that any purpose in the Will would damp it; clearly the "lust of result" is a thing from which it must be delivered. </p>

<p>But the phrase must also be interpreted as if read, "without purpose unassuaged" --- i.e., with tireless energy. The conception is therefore, of eternal motion, infinite and unalterable. It is Nirvana, only dynamic instead of static --- and this comes to the same thing in the end. </p>

<p>The obvious practical task of the magician is to discover what is Will really is, so that he may do it in this manner, and he can best accomplish this by the practices of Liber Thisarb (see Equinox I. VII. 105) or such others as may from one time or another be appointed. </p>
 <p>It should be perfectly simple for everybody to understand the Message of Master Therion. </p>

<p>Thou must:
(1) Find out what id thy Will.  (2) Do that Will (a)one-pointed ness,<br> (b) detachment, (c) peace. </p>

<p>Then, and only then, art thou in harmony with the Movement of the Things, thy Will part of, and therefore equal to, the Will of God. And since two different selves could not possess identical wills; then, if thy Will be God's Will, Thou art that. </p>

<p>There is but one other word to explain. Elsewhere it is written --- surely for our great comfort --- "Love is the Law, love under will." </p>

<p>This is to be taken as meaning that while Will is the Law; the nature of that Will is Love. But this Love is as if it were a by-product of that Will; and if apparent contradiction should arise in any crisis; it is the Will that will guide us aright. Lo, while in the Book of the Law there is much of Love, there is no word of Sentimentality. Hate itself is almost Love! Fighting is most certainly like Love! :"As brothers fight ye!" All the manly races of the world understand this. The Love of Liber Legis is always bold, virile even orgiastic. There is delicacy, but it is delicacy of strength. Mighty and terrible and glorious as it is, however, it is but the pennon upon the swords of the Knight-monks of Thelema. </p>
